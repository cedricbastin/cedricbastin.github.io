# The State of cables in 2020

"USB was designed to standardize the connection of peripherals to personal computers, both to communicate with and to supply electric power. It has largely replaced interfaces such as serial ports and parallel ports,"

USB 1.0 01.1996 1.5 Mbit/s (Low Bandwidth or Low Speed)
USB 1.1 08.1998 12 Mbit/s (Full Speed) [type A & B]
USB 2.0 04.2000 480 Mbit/s High Speed or High Bandwidth [type mini A mini B]
USB 3.0 11.2008 (USB 3.1 Gen 1) 5 Gbit/s (SuperSpeed)
USB 3.1 07.2013 (USB 3.1 Gen 2) 10 Gbit/s (SuperSpeed+)
USB 3.2 08.2017 (USB 3.2 Gen 2 x 2) 20 Gbit/s (SuperSpeed+)
USB4 08.2019 40 Gbit/s (SuperSpeed+ and Thunderbolt 3)

PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) PCIe "It is the common motherboard interface for personal computers' graphics cards, hard drives, SSDs, Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connections."
- Defined by its number of lanes
- used in a variety of other standards, most notably the laptop expansion card interface ExpressCard and computer storage interfaces SATA Express, U.2 (SFF-8639) and M.2.

"Shortly before the release of the new machines, the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) announced they would not allow such a combination port, and that USB was not open to modification in that way."
TB1 10 Gbit/s 02.2011 mini Displayport (4× PCI Express 2.0, DisplayPort 1.1a)
TB2 20 Gbit/s 06.2013 (4× PCI Express 2.0, DisplayPort 1.2)
TB3 40 Gbit/s 12.2015 (4× PCI Express 3.0, DisplayPort 1.2 (8-lane, 2 streams),[4] USB 3.1 gen. 2)

24 May 2017 -> " Intel announced that Thunderbolt 3 would become a royalty-free standard to OEMs and chip manufacturers in 2018"

FireWire 400 01.1995 (~400 Mbit/s) 6-conductor
FireWire 800 2002  (~800 Mbit/s) 9-conductor

1990 Ethernet uses twisted pair cables 10 Mbit/s 10BASE-T 
The Ethernet standard has been able to push its throughput beyond 10 Gigabits per second by improving the shielding in its twisted pair cables (Cat 6) and by modifying the protocol to use a faster frequency. 

It's just an interface -> like Ethernet: PoE VoE class 5 etc

USB became ubiquitous in the 2000s because it presented a combined interface for many peripherals (mouse, keyboard, printer, webcam, flash drives). It made replaced many legacy and serial ports and cleaned up the backside of many computer and paved the way for laptops to become slimmer.

However it was still too slow to 

There seems to be some confusion over Thunderbolt 3.
It does not only have the USB-C form factor but is also an Alternate Mode of USB-C meaning that it can do everything USB-C does, plus the Thunderbolt 3 stuff on top. This is also which allows charging (100W) as this part of the USB-C port configuration. This also means that any USB-C Display can be used on the new MacBook Pros. Actually USB-C also support Alternate mode for DisplayPort and HDMI which is the reason why it can run displays.
