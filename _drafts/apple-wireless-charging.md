# Apple and Qi Wireless Charging

Depending on who you ask Apple is either to slow or too fast in adopting new technologies.
On one hand Apple never put a Blue-ray player into any of their computer, on the other hand they removed all ports on their MacBooks with 4 USBC port, before that standard was widespread.
It's interesting to keep an eye out for these evolutions and make a guess why Apple is going a particular route.

Apple introduced its first wirelessly charging device in 2015 when the first Apple Watch was revealed in April.
Using the included 5 Watt charger, the watch could be charged to 80% in 1.5h and 100% in 2h.
However does the Apple Watch not support standard wireless charging, instead it uses a proprietary implementation which requires users to buy special cables from Apple directly.
Even though the Apple Watch 3 was able to charge on some non-[MFi][mfi] for a [short period of time][apple-watch-3], Apple never enabled this fully for all Apple Watch Models.

Apple was criticized for supporting wireless charging on their phones earlier.
High-end Samsung Galaxy phones support wireless charging since 2015 with the introduction of the S6, but even before separate cases and back covers could be bought, that included this feature.

In the early days of wireless charging there were 2 competing standard: Qi from the WPC (Wireless Power Consortium) and Powermat from PMA (Power Matters Alliance).
Both standard were supported by different large-scale player, PMA was backed by Starbucks, AT&T and Delta Airlines whereas the Qi standard had MacDonald's, Verizon and Nokia behind it.
While not very different from an electrical perspective they used different protocols and thus were not inter-compatible.
In fact early devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6, supported both standards! 

Apple introduced wireless charging to its iPhone in 2017 with the iPhone 8 (Plus) and iPhone X, which were the first phone to re-introduce glass back covers, as wireless charging does not work through an aluminium enclosures.
Apple chose to incorporate the Qi wireless charging standard in their phones, which has been included in every model released since.
It's not clear whether Apple preferred Qi from a technical perspective or if they got a better licensing agreement, fact is that PMA hasn't made many headlines since then.

Apple doesn't like to introduce new hardware for the sake of it, they like to have a long term strategy.
When the first iPhones with wireless charging shipped, the Qi charging speed was capped at 5W.
It was only later that year that Apple enabled faster 7.5W charging via a software update in iOS 11.2.

Another interesting episode from Apple history with wireless charging is AirPower.
Announced in September 2017, along the highly anticipated iPhone X, this wireless charging mat was supposed to be able to charge 3 devices at once, including the Apple Watch (which does not use the Qi charging standard).
After many months of rumors and anticipation for the device, Apple [canceled][airpower-cancelled] the device citing high standard, many believing that they have run into issues with heat management.

In October 2020, 3 years after AirPower was announced, Apple is shipping its first Apple-branded wireless charger, dubbed 'MagSafe', in a nod to the original MacBook magnetic charger.
It work by perfectly aligning the charging coils with the help oh a ring of magnets, which allows it to charge the new iPhones at 15 Watt speeds.
It is still to be seem whether this charger will also charge non-Apple devices and at which speed.
In addition Apple will also be using these magnets to create an ecosystem of accessories, such as cases, stands and phone holders, that which will snap onto the device.
This technology also seems to be stackable such that you can use a case, a wallet and a charging mat combined!
No reviewer has yet had their hand on the new devices, so it is not clear yet how well this will work in practice.

It is rumored that Apple wants to move to en entirely port-less iPhone design in the coming years (which is probably also the reason why no iPhone with USBC will ever exist).
To achieve this, they need to provide a viable alternative for wired fast charging, which is going up to 20 Watt via USBC PD (Power Delivery) on the 2020 iPhone lineup.

It's a very Apple-like approach to build a proprietary solution on top of an existing open source standard.
It will be interesting to see how many 3rd parties will integrate with this new feature, but it is clear that Apple bets on this technology and we will see more devices which include it going forward.
As the AirPods cases and Apple Watches are smaller that the ring of magnets it will be interesting which integration they will provide when their next iterations will be announced.
It might be the best of both world, being able to use any wireless charging mat (at a reduced speed) while getting the best experience with an iPhone-specific MagSafe charger.
