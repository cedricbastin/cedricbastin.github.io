# How to sort personal photos

- HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
Digital Cameras have been around for many decades now, but how do you sort your digital pictures? Digital photos have the disadvantage that you don't just stumble over them in a box on the attic. They are also much more convenient to take and cheaper to store that we take a lot more pictures, so organization becomes key to have you photo collection survive many years. I won't be talking about professional tools such as Lightroom, as this is about personal pictures that should survive many decades without being locked in an old media library that you can't access anymore.

- APPLE PHOTOS & GOOGLE PHOTOS
As we take most of our personal pictures on our smartphones anyways, it is great to use the tools (The problem with Live Photos)
-- so from time to time you should bulk copy all you photos into a folder

- FILES AND FOLDERS
If you are storing pictures for a long time you probably want to rely on a basic and established system such as basic files & folder in the file browser of your computer. They are easy to transfer to friends or family and it is also easier to create backups of your photos. The major disadvantage is that a pictures cannot be in multiple albums like `nature`, `friends` and `hiking`. So we have to think in terms of `levels`, I want enough to be descriptive enough but not too many that you have to 

- FOLDERS ARE ALBUMS
As most photos are related to an event at a specific date and time you should group together chunks of ~30 pictures into folders that have a very descriptive name as this will be the only way of easily searching them using your computers. Computers are also really dumb when it comes to sorting, they can only sort folders in an alphabetical way (sorting by date doesn't make sense for folder). You should only use the the [Asian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_Asia#Date) date notation in it's 0-padded version `YYYY-MM-DD` to prefix your album (folder) names. This will make it very straightforward to get a nice chronological view of all your albums.

- CHUNKS OF 5 YEARS
I used to have categories such as `family`, `friends`, `school` but it quickly got messy as some events are shared between more categories such that I didn't know where to put them, or where to find them afterwards. So I went back to the idea of chronological sorting, but I didn't want to have have a list with 1000s of albums to scroll through every time, so it's good to define chunks of ~5 years that thematically fit together. This doesn't mean that anything which is in the `University` super-folder actually took place at university but rather they are a

- DIGITAL HYGIENE
I have recently started to clean up my digital life, in order to maintain the so-called "digital hygiene". From using a password manager, maintaining an empty email inbox, tracking important events in my calendar and what's important for this article sorting personal pictures. Sometimes I think about what digital information is most important to me, I would mind loosing my university or work documents much less than loosing access to my personal pictures for instance. Of course backups are one thing that everyone should do, but you pictures should also be organized in such a way that it is easy browse. This post is written from the perspective of a Mac user, as I'm not sure about all the Application names on Windows, but I'm sure it is not that different.

- HISTORY: DIGITAL CAMERA
Many of us were excited when digital photography became affordable for families and amateurs in the early 2000s. Photos became instantly viewable on the computer and where easy to duplicate to pass them on to friends on family on a USB stick. Then came smartphones and social media in the 2010s which made it even easier to view, share and combine photos of important life events. However since then more people have tried to move away from huge online information agglomerates such as facebook to bring such personal things as photos back into our control. The question we are left with now is how to organize the pictures in such a way that that we can easily find back a picture or memory that we are looking for.

- NOT PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS
I will not be talking about how to organize photos from a professional context. I do not know if professional photographers prefer to group their photos by project, by client or by camera. This post is only about how to organize your personal photo memories in well defined chunks that are easy to browse even in a few years when your collection grows considerably. As I understand it Adobe Lightroom is used by many to annotate photos using tags and additional tools such as star ratings and favorites which make it easy to filter through large collections of similar pictures from the same photoshoot. Even though some of these principles might apply to smaller, personal photo libraries such as 'favorites' we will talk about those later.

- USING THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU RIGHT NOW
As smartphones cameras get better every year, with high-end devices having surpassed the photo quality of basic compact models, they become our de-facto point-and-shoot devices for everyday moments. As most modern smartphones are either running Android or iOS we also get to use their respective photo management software, namely Google Photos and Apple Photos. The Apps live on our phones, on our computers and even on the internet. They allow you favorite, share and even edit photos. Though they are mainly photo libraries which allow you to easily navigate and  find photos. As photos have a lot of metadata attached to them (date, location, camera, lenses...) thus you can easily search for a photos in a specific date range or even location. Additionally all these modern software has enough smarts build in that you can search for "cat", "wedding" or even "food". No amount of manual work can make up for that!

- CLOUD STORAGE
Most of us end up taking most of our personal photos with our smartphones, such that in the end the photos will be synced to the Apple iCloud Photo Library or to Google Photos. These Tools are great because they have many advantages build it. Right now my iCloud Photo library has almost 30'000 pictures in my iCloud libraries which takes up 90GB of my iCloud storage but only 1.5GB on my iPhone. This is due the 'Optimize iPhone Storage' option which offloads most of the pictures that I don't look at often enough to the Cloud. A very similar story is true for Android and Google Photos, except that you get unlimited free cloud storage for your photos, except that photos will be resized to a maximum of 16MP and videos are resized to 1080px. So I do prefer paying for iCloud storage knowing that my photos will always be full quality.

- WAIT FOR THE TOOLS TO BE GOOD ENOUGH
Tools will only get better and they are indeed getting better very fast with more advanced technology such as machine learning and face recognition. so don't spend too much time on a task that in the future is most likely to get automated. When I tried using Picasa as my photo management software I spent huge amounts of time to annotate people face's with their corresponding names. Then I stopped using Picasa and lost all of that work, however nowadays it would also be a redundant job as face recognition software is much better than it used to be.

- DON'T TRUST MEDIA DATABASES
However even though I praised modern photo library management tools earlier for their ease of use, you shouldn't trust them too much. I used Picasa for while but then switched to iPhoto as it integrated more easily with iPhone. So quite often the camera you use limits the options of software that work well with it. Also when Google discontinued Picasa in 2016 and launched Google Photos, they did provide an easy migration tool to bring all your well organized photos to their shiny new service. https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/how-to-transfer-photos-from-picasa-to-google-photos/ Similarly Apple switched from iPhoto to Apple Photos in 2015, even though they had a migration path many things could go wrong which could either end up you loosing pictures, duplicating them, or revealing a bunch of random thumbnails that were used internally to represent people's faces and such. (which is what happened to a friend of mine)
In general the issue with these Apps is that they hide their internal database structure such that it gets really hard to get pictures out of these services and how to interoperate with
