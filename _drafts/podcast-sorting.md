- weird world of pre-streaming on demand content

- shows 
	- subscribed: Boolean
- episodes
	- downloaded
	- listened: Percentage (0%->Unlistened, X%-> listening, 95%->finished)

mutually exclusive

What I would like:
- See shows I'm subscribed to
	- ordered alphabetically
	- ordered by most recently updated => Listen Now
- see episodes
	- downloaded

Apple podcast
- 'Listen Now'	-> smartly sorted
- 'Shows' -> Shows with at least one show downloaded (sorted by Title or Date Added)
There is also Manual Sorting 

- see all shows that I'm subscribed to
- see all episodes of shows that I am subscribed to that I have downloaded,
